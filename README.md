# About Website

Our website is built on cutting-edge technologies and aims to simplify the user's product selection process. It features fast filtering options based on medicine names, types, and prices. For unregistered users, we've implemented a quick functionality for selection and ordering. And for those who value convenience, a single registration allows for automatic field population during purchase. Additionally, we've created a page for purchase history and, most importantly, a personalized discounts page! So hurry up and join us for a seamless experience!

The site consists of a home page, authorization pages, shopping page, history, and discount pages.
